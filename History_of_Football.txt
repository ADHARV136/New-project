Football (or soccer as the game is called in some parts of the world) has a long history. 
Football in its current form arose in England in the middle of the 19th century. But alternative versions of the game 
existed much earlier and are a part of the football history.


Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer,[a] is a team sport played between two teams of 11 players
 each, who primarily use their feet to propel a ball around a rectangular field called a pitch. The objective of the game
 is to score more goals than the opposing team by moving the ball beyond the goal line into a rectangular-framed goal 
defended by the opposing team. Traditionally, the game has been played over two 45-minute halves, for a total match time
 of 90 minutes. With an estimated 250 million players active in over 200 countries and territories, it is the world's 
most popular sport.

Kicking ball games arose independently multiple times across multiple cultures.[b] Phaininda and episkyros were Greek 
ball games.[15][16] An image of an episkyros player depicted in low relief on a stele of c. 375–400 BCE in the National 
Archaeological Museum of Athens[14] appears on the UEFA European Championship trophy.[17] Athenaeus, writing in 228 CE,
 mentions the Roman ball game harpastum. Phaininda, episkyros and harpastum were played involving hands and violence. 
They all appear to have resembled rugby football, wrestling and volleyball more than what is recognisable as modern 
football.[18][19][20][21][22][23] As with pre-codified mob football, the antecedent of all modern football codes, these 
three games involved more handling the ball than kicking it.[24][25]

The Chinese competitive game cuju (蹴鞠, literally "kick ball"; also known as tsu chu) resembles modern association 
football.[26] Cuju players could use any part of the body apart from hands and the intent was to kick a ball through 
an opening into a net. During the Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE), cuju games were standardised and rules were 
established.[18] Other East Asian games included kemari in Japan and chuk-guk in Korea, both influenced by cuju.[27][28] 
Kemari originated after the year 600 during the Asuka period. It was a ceremonial rather than a competitive game, 
and involved the kicking of a mari, a ball made of animal skin.[29] In North America, pasuckuakohowog was a ball game 
played by the Algonquians; it was described as "almost identical to the kind of folk football being played in Europe 
at the same time, in which the ball was kicked through goals".[30]
